# vault
Vault creates a protected folder, where you can easily protect your files with a password.


# instructions
After saving the file, edit it with Notepad.
Change "ENTER-YOUR-PASSWORD-THERE" (line 66) with the password you want to use and save the file, then open it.
Insert files you want to protect into the folder "Vault", so re-open the file.
Confirm to protect the Vault, so that the folder will apparently disappear.
To view and use the Vault, open the file and insert your password.

# how does it work?
Vault provides to create a folder with a really simple program. This folder will disappear after you confirm you want to do it. At the beginning, you will see that it changed name, but if you refresh the page it will disappear, until you will open the file and insert your password. If the password is incorrect, the program will be closed, but none of the files will be deleted: you can retry to enter the correct password as many times as you want, but every time you have to re-open the file: so bruteforce attacks don't work on this program.

# really important
You must save the file as .bat, so that windows will execute it. If you just copy the strings and paste them into notepad, it won't work. Please download directly the file.
